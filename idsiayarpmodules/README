THIS DIRECTORY TREE CONTAINS SOURCE CODE, DOCUMENTATION AND BUILD SCRIPTS FOR
EXTENSION MODULS FOR YARP DEVELOPED FOR USE IN IDSIA.

INITIALLY IT CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING MODULES:
- A DRIVER FOR FIREWIRE CAMERAS
- A DRIVER FOR KATANA400 ROBOTS
- SEVERAL FILTERS FOR YARP COMMUNICATION CHANNELS, INTENDED AS HOCK-IN POINTS
  for e.g. COLLISION AVOIDANCE CONTROL
- SEVERAL SIMPLE EXAMPLE PROGRAMS


HOW TO BUILD THIS MODULES USING CMAKE
------------------------------------

1. Make sure you have CMake installed and working
2. Make sure you have YARP installed and working
3. Change into the build directory:  'cd build'
4. Run 'cmake ..' several times (it takes 3 times for me) until
   there are no more changes to in the command line output
5. Run 'ccmake ..', 'cmake-gui ..' or an equivalent interface to
   configure the CMake build process. Ensure that you have set
   the following values:
     - ENABLE_idsiayarpmod_firewirecamera2  on
     - ENABLE_idsiayarpmod_katana400        on
     - CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS                      -m32
     - CMAKE_C_FLAGS                        -m32
     - CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX                 <according to your needs> (this is optional)
   Run configure several times until nothing changes anymore
   Run generate
   Quit the cmake configuration interface
6. Run 'make clean'
7. Run 'make'
8. optional: Run 'make install'



The initial content of this directory tree has been developed in the course of my
master thesis at IDSIA's robotics lab.
