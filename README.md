icVision
========

icVision is an easy-to-use, modular framework performing computer vision related tasks in support of cognitive robotics research on the iCub humanoid robot.  The system currently allows object recognition and localisation in 3D space.  One of the main design goals is to allow rapid prototyping and testing of vision software on the iCub and reduce development time by removing redundant and repetitive processes. icVision is implemented in C++ and uses the YARP middleware and OpenCV for the underlying image processing.
