<h2 class="chapter">2 Introduction</h2>

<p>
SOLID is a software library containing functions for performing
intersection tests and proximity queries that are useful in the context
of collision detection. Collision detection is the process of detecting
pairs of geometric objects that are intersecting or are within a given
proximity of each other. In particular, SOLID is useful for detecting
collisions between objects that are moving relatively of each other over
time. The motions of objects are controlled by the client application,
and are not determined or affected by SOLID. 

Furthermore, SOLID provides functionality for determining geometric data
pertaining to a pair of objects that is used by the client application
for computing the appropriate response to a collision. This data,
referred to as response data, is passed to the client application by
means of a callback mechanism or by direct queries from the client
application. 


<h3 class="section">2.1 Overview</h3>

<p>
SOLID's functionality is subdivided into the following categories:

     <ol type=1 start=1>

<li>Shape definition
<li>Object placement and motion 
<li>Scene management
<li>Response definition
<li>Global actions
<li>Broad phase

        </ol>


<h4 class="subsection">2.1.1 Shape Definition</h4>

<p>
The shape of a geometric object is defined relative to its local
coordinate system. A shape can be a simple geometric primitive, e.g., a
sphere or a line segment, or a complex shape composed of multiple
primitives. Shapes defined in terms of vertex positions, e.g., a
triangle mesh, may use vertex data that is stored in memory maintained
by the client application. 


<h4 class="subsection">2.1.2 Object Placement and Motion</h4>

<p>
A geometric object is defined by a shape, an affine transformation, and
a margin. The shape is placed in the world coordinate system by
specifying the object's local coordinate system represented by an affine
transformation. 
The actual object is the set of points in world coordinates whose distance to
the shape  is at most the margin. Motion of an object can be defined by 
changing the placement of the local coordinate system, the margin, or the
positions of the vertices of the shape.  



<h4 class="subsection">2.1.3 Scene Management</h4>

<p>
Collections of objects on which collision detection has to be performed
are placed in a scene. SOLID is capable of maintaining multiple
scenes. Objects can be shared by multiple scenes. A scene maintains
cached data pertaining to the objects in the scene in order to speed-up
consecutive collision queries that are performed on the scene. 


<h4 class="subsection">2.1.4 Response Definition</h4>

<p>
In SOLID, collision response is handled by callback functions.
The types of response and the callback functions that needs to be executed
for each pair of intersecting objects is stored in a response
table. Currently, there are three types of response: 
     <ol type=1 start=1>
 
<li>Simple response: no response data is returned.
<li>Witnessed response: a common point of the intersecting objects is
returned. 
<li>Depth response: the penetration depth of the intersecting objects
is returned. The penetration depth is the shortest vector over which one
of the objects needs to be translated in order to bring the objects into
touching contact. 
  
        </ol>
Response tables can be shared by multiple scenes, and per scene multiple
response tables can be used. To each object that is considered for
collision detection in a response table, a response class is
assigned. Responses can be defined per pair of response classes, on all
pairs containing a specific response class, or as a default for all
pairs of response classes. 
On a pair of response classes multiple responses can be defined. 
During the lifetime of an object, it is possible to
reassign the response class associated with the object per response
table. 

  

<h4 class="subsection">2.1.5 Global Actions</h4>

<p>
The main functionality of SOLID is to perform collision tests. Given a
scene and a response table, a collision test computes for all pairs of
colliding objects on which a response is defined the required response data and
passes these data together with the colliding pair to the callback. The
response actions are defined by the client 
application in the callback and fall outside the scope of SOLID. 

The client application may also obtain response data for a given object or
pair of objects by direct queries. These direct queries are useful for static
interference checks or for tracking the closest points of a pair of objects.


<h4 class="subsection">2.1.6 Broad Phase</h4>

<p>
The broad phase detects changes in the overlap status of pairs of
axis-aligned boxes. The overlap status of a pair of boxes changes
whenever the boxes start or cease to overlap. The boxes are organized in
scenes similar to the scenes for objects. For each pair of boxes in a
scene whose overlap status is changed a callback is called. The client
defines a callback for pairs that start to overlap and one for pairs
that cease to overlap. The broad phase is actually a sub-layer of the
SOLID library, however the API can be directly accessed by the client
application.   




<h3 class="section">2.2 Software Package</h3>

<p>
Currently, the SOLID package consists of three separate layers: 
     <ol type=1 start=1>

<li>MT: The Mathematics Toolkit. This is a set of C++ classes containing
abstract data types for scalars, vectors, points, quaternions, matrices,
coordinate systems, and bounding boxes. Global names in this layer are
prefixed with "MT_".  

<li>The broad phase: A set of C++ classes wrapped by a C API. The broad
phase detects changes in the overlap status of pairs of axis-aligned
boxes (pairs of boxes that start or cease to overlap). Global names in this
layer are prefixed with "BP_". 

<li>The narrow phase: A set of C++ classes wrapped by a C API. The narrow
phase performs exact collision tests for pairs of objects, and computes
response data for the colliding pairs of objects. Global names in this layer
are prefixed with "DT_".  

        </ol>


<h3 class="section">2.3 New Features of SOLID version 3</h3>

<p>
Since the previous version 2.0 of SOLID, which was released in June 1998
under the terms of the GNU Library General Public License by the
Department of Mathematics &amp; Computing Science of Eindhoven University of
Technology, SOLID has evolved and matured considerably. New
features as well as improvements for robustness and performance have
been added. The most important changes in SOLID 3 are: 
     <ul>

<li>Use of single-precision floating-point numbers. The use of a
32-bit floating-point format is a requirement for games and other
interactive applications that run on current PC graphics hardware and
consoles.   

<li>Penetration depth computation as a new response type. The
penetration depth of a pair of intersecting objects is the shortest
vector over which one of the objects needs to be translated in order to
bring the objects in touching contact. The penetration depth can be used
as an approximation of the contact point and contact plane, which are
necessary for physics-based simulation. The depth response replaces the
smart response in SOLID 2.0. Smart response uses the configuration of
the previous time frame for finding the contact points and plane, which
could give bad results when objects were interpenetrating over a number
of frames. 

<li>SOLID 3 maintains multiple scenes. This feature is useful when
collision detection is required for multiple tasks. For instance, it is
possible to maintain at the same time a sound scene, a scene used for
visibility culling, and a scene for physics simulations, without the
objects in different scenes interfering with each other. 

<li>Stridden vertex arrays can be used for defining complex shapes. 

<li>Objects can be expanded spherically, i.e., a margin that defines
the radius of the sphere that is 'added' can be set for each object. The
object is the set of points whose distance to the shape is at most the
margin. Margins are useful for creating objects with rounded edges, or
'sensitive' areas around an object.        

<li>Functions for direct computation of response data have been added
to the API. This is useful, since it allows the client to
check overlap status, distance, etc., without having to perform a global
collision test. 

<li>A ray cast has been added to SOLID. The ray cast returns the
object in a scene that the ray hits first. Also, the hit spot and
surface normal to this object are returned. 

<li>Response callbacks are defined in a response table independent of
a scene. 

<li>Response callbacks are defined per pair of response classes rather
than per object pair. With each object for which a response is defined
in a response table, a response class is associated. The response class
of an object may change over time. 

<li>It is now possible to define multiple response callbacks per
object pair.  This is useful for performing several actions for a single
collision (play sound, apply impulse, update statistics). 


</ul>
