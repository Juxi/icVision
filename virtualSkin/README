THIS DIRECTORY TREE CONTAINS SOURCE CODE, AND BUILD SCRIPTS FOR THE IM-CLEVER KINEMATICS COMMAND FILTER, ALSO CALLED

VIRTUAL SKIN

INITIALLY IT CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING:
- A static library for building and moving a kinematic robot model
- A static library containing a port filter for YARP communication channels (contributed by Gregor Kaufmann) which is also available as part of "idsiaYarpModules"
- An example program that integrates these two libraries, providing reflexive response to collision (self collision or collision with objects in the environment)
- A simple control program for the iCub robot that does motor babbling with position and velocity control

DOCUMENTATION IS CURRENTLY INCOMPLETE, BUT IS COMING SOON.

HOW TO BUILD THIS MODULES USING CMAKE
------------------------------------

1. Make sure you have all dependencies installed and working...
	CMake >= 2.6
	YARP >= 2.6
	Qt >= 4
	OpenGL
	FreeSOLID
2. From somewhereOnYourSystem/virtualSkin do the following:

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	(optional) ccmake ..		(to tweak build options i.e. to set build type to DEBUG)
	make
	(optional) make install		(this will install build products to	somewhereOnYourSystem/virtualSkin/bin
										somewhereOnYourSystem/virtualSkin/lib


The content of this directory was developed during the fist year of my PhD at IDSIA's robotics lab.
