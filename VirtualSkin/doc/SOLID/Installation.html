<h2 class="chapter">3 Installing the SOLID SDK</h2>

<p>

<h3 class="section">3.1 Requirements</h3>

<p>
The SOLID library (libsolid) and the broad-phase library (libbroad) have a
standard C API and can be linked to both C and C++ 
applications.  
Note that libsolid and libbroad are internally coded in C++ and
thus need the libstdc++ library on Unix platforms (link using g++ rather
than gcc).
The mathematics toolkit (MT) is coded in standard C++ and uses templates
extensively. The source code compiles under GNU g++ version 2.95 and higher
and Microsoft Visual C++ version 6.0 SP4 and higher.
 





<h3 class="section">3.2 Installation</h3>

<p>
All header files that export types and functions are stored in the
`<samp><span class="samp">include</span></samp>' directory. 
Source files are stored in the `<samp><span class="samp">src</span></samp>' directory.
On a Unix-like operating system, a `<samp><span class="samp">configure</span></samp>' script generated by the
GNU build tools (automake, autoconf, libtool) is used for creating the
Makefiles. 
Simply type `<samp><span class="samp">./configure</span></samp>' followed by `<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>' in the root of the
SOLID distribution directory to build the SOLID lib and example programs.
Typing `<samp><span class="samp">make install</span></samp>' installs the SOLID library header files and
binaries as well as this documentation in `<samp><span class="samp">/usr/local</span></samp>'. 
Note that you usually must have root privileges for adding items to
`<samp><span class="samp">/usr/local</span></samp>'.
See `<samp><span class="samp">./configure --help</span></samp>' for installing the library in a different
location.

The SOLID library can be built under Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 and higher using
the workspace (.dsw) and project (.dsp) files found in the `<samp><span class="samp">VisualC6</span></samp>' 
directory.  
For use with Visual C++ 7.0 and higher, the workspace and project files must
first be converted to the newer solution (.sln) and project (.vcproj) formats. 
On a Win32 platform, the simplest way to make the
SOLID SDK accessible in your applications is to add the SOLID
`<samp><span class="samp">include</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">lib</span></samp>' directories to respectively the include and link
path used by the compiler. 
For running executables built using SOLID, the `<samp><span class="samp">solid.dll</span></samp>' should be
contained in the executable search path.  
This is achieved most easily by copying these DLLs either to the directory
containing the executable or to the `<samp><span class="samp">WINxxxx/system32</span></samp>' directory.

SOLID uses the Qhull library for computing convex hulls of sets of points. 
In case the Qhull library is not available for your platform, SOLID can still
be built. However, in that case, queries on convex hulls built with
<code>DT_NewPolytope</code> (see below) fall back to brute force algorithms, 
and are therefore much slower.
In order to build a SOLID library without Qhull, make sure that the
preprocessing flag `<samp><span class="samp">-DQHULL</span></samp>' is not set.

The core of SOLID may use either single or double precision floating-point
arithmetic.
The default option is single-precision.
In order to build a double-precision SOLID core, use `<samp><span class="samp">configure</span></samp>' with
the `<samp><span class="samp">--enable-doubles</span></samp>' option.
Under Visual C++, doubles can be enabled using the `<samp><span class="samp">-DUSE_DOUBLES</span></samp>'
preprocessing flag.
Note that this flag only affects the floating-point numbers that are used
internally in SOLID. 
The API functions always use single-precision floating-point numbers.
    
In the same way, the SOLID core can be built using a tracer class for
scalars. 
See the file `<samp><span class="samp">MT_ScalarTracer.h</span></samp>' in the `<samp><span class="samp">include</span></samp>' directory.
A scalar tracer is used for tracing rounding errors in results of
floating-point operations. 
An object of the type <code>MT_ScalarTracer</code> has a value field and an error
field. The value field holds the result of an operation, and the error
field multiplied by the machine epsilon gives an estimated upper bound for the
relative rounding error. 
The <code>MT_ScalarTracer</code> class behaves as the primitive scalar types
<code>float</code> and <code>double</code>, however, constants of this type have to be
constructed explicitly.   
In order to build a SOLID core that uses scalar tracers, create Makefiles using
`<samp><span class="samp">configure</span></samp>' with the `<samp><span class="samp">--enable-tracer</span></samp>' option.
Under Visual C++, the tracers are enabled using the `<samp><span class="samp">-DUSE_TRACER</span></samp>'
preprocessing flag.
This option is very useful for debugging purposes.
Makefiles for building debug binaries of SOLILD are created using the
`<samp><span class="samp">--enable-debug</span></samp>' option.
